Trying to use my Google Maps timeline data outside of Google Maps after loosing
my Timeline data because Google servers are not to be trusted apparently.

It kinda worked to display the points from my timeline files (retrieved using Google Takeouts) 
but unfortunately most of the data is missing.

To run it you'll have to provide your timeline data file (put it in the same folder as this project) and run
```
go run main.go
```
